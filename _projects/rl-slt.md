## Overview
This stream builds reinforcement-learning systems embedded in clinician workflows to personalize and optimize speech–language therapy, improving both treatment efficiency and child outcomes while preserving clinician oversight.

## What we do
We model therapy adaptation as a sequential decision process and develop human-in-the-loop systems that provide recommendations while keeping clinicians in control.

## Key components
- Reinforcement learning models of therapy adaptation  
- Human-in-the-loop decision support  
- Workflow integration for clinicians  
- Optimization of outcomes and efficiency
