## Overview

Building computational models that simulate language acquisition processes in children and second language learners. This project bridges developmental psychology and computational linguistics.

**Lead Researcher:** Dr. James Wilson  
**Timeline:** 2024-2027  
**Funding:** SSHRC Insight Grant

### Key Components

- Computational models of vocabulary growth
- Syntax acquisition simulations
- Individual differences in learning trajectories
