## Overview
This project investigates early neural markers and developmental trajectories of language disorders in bilingual children by combining longitudinal behavioral assessment with non-invasive neuroimaging.

## What we do
We examine neural systems supporting language processing, working memory, and cognitive control over development, with the goal of distinguishing transient delays from persistent disorders.

## Key components
- Longitudinal bilingual language assessment  
- Functional neuroimaging (e.g., fNIRS)  
- Early neural markers of risk and resilience  
- Trajectory-based characterization of language disorders
