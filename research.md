# Research Overview

COALab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory dedicated to understanding and supporting children with speech, language, and reading difficulties. Our work sits at the intersection of **speech-language pathology, developmental neuroscience, and artificial intelligence**, with a shared goal: **to improve how language disorders are identified, understood, and treated—earlier, more fairly, and more effectively**.

Language disorders such as developmental language disorder and dyslexia affect millions of children worldwide and often remain under-identified, particularly in bilingual populations. At COALab, we combine **behavioral assessment, brain-based measures, and computational modeling** to better capture individual differences in language development and to translate scientific insight into clinically meaningful tools.

Our research program is organized around three tightly connected directions.

## Core Research Areas

### Oral & Written Language Disorders
<a id="disorders"></a>
**Focus:** Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)

We study speech, language, and reading difficulties across development, including developmental speech-language disorders and dyslexia. Our work is grounded in clinical speech-language pathology and focuses on understanding how language difficulties appear in real children across ages, languages, and learning contexts. Rather than treating disorders as uniform categories, we aim to capture their **heterogeneity** and to improve assessment and intervention in diverse and bilingual settings.

**Key questions include:**
- What cognitive and linguistic mechanisms underlie different language and reading difficulties?
- How can we better characterize individual profiles of oral and written language impairment?
- How can assessment better reflect bilingual development and everyday communication?

### Developmental Neuroscience
<a id="neuroscience"></a>
**Focus:** Neural Bases of Language Development

From a developmental neuroscience perspective, we investigate how brain development supports language learning—and how this process differs in children with language disorders. We use **child-friendly neuroimaging methods**, particularly **functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)**, to study neural activity during language, working memory, and cognitive-control tasks. Our goal is to complement behavioral assessment and identify neural markers that help explain developmental pathways and intervention response, especially in young and bilingual children.

**Key questions include:**
- How does the developing “language brain” differ in children with language disorders?
- Can early neural markers help predict later language outcomes?
- How does brain plasticity support learning and recovery over time?

### Artificial Intelligence & Computational Modeling
<a id="ai"></a>
**Focus:** AI for Speech-Language Development and Disorders and Cognitive Health

A central feature of COALab’s work is the use of AI and computational modeling to better understand speech-language development and to support clinical decision-making. We develop **voice-based AI tools**, computational and **Bayesian** models of speech-language and reading, and **decision-support systems** that assist—not replace—clinicians. Our AI research emphasizes **interpretability, fairness, and clinical relevance**, ensuring that models integrate smoothly into real-world clinical workflows.

Key directions include:
- Voice-based screening tools for early identification of speech-language disorders  
- Computational and Bayesian models of dyslexia that capture individual differences and cross-linguistic variability  
- Reinforcement-learning systems that help personalize speech-language therapy while keeping clinicians in control  

**Key questions include:**
- Can speech and language patterns in children’s voices support earlier and fairer screening?
- How can computational models help explain different developmental pathways in reading and language?
- Can AI help clinicians tailor therapy more efficiently to each child’s needs?

## Research Facilities

## Funding & Collaborations

Our research program is supported by competitive funding from major Canadian research and innovation organizations, including:

- **Brain Canada Foundation**  
- **Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)**  
- **Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)**  
- **Digital Research Alliance of Canada**
