# Research Overview

COALab is an interdisciplinary laboratory focusing on cognition, oral and written language disorders, and artificial intelligence. Our core mission is to combine multidisciplinary approaches to study the causes and mechanisms of language disorders and to explore novel assessment and intervention methods.

## Core Research Areas

### Oral & Written Language Disorders
<a id="disorders"></a>
**Focus:** Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)

We investigate a range of oral and written language disorders, including developmental language delays, dyslexia, and aphasia. Our work is grounded in speech-language pathology, aiming to characterize the nature of these disorders at the behavioral level.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the underlying cognitive deficits in specific language disorders?
- How can we better characterize oral and written language impairments?
- What are the most effective intervention strategies?

### Developmental Neuroscience
<a id="neuroscience"></a>
**Focus:** Neural Mechanisms of Language

From the perspective of developmental neuroscience, we explore the neural basis of language disorders. We use neuroimaging techniques to understand brain development, neural connectivity, and how structural or functional abnormalities relate to language deficits.

**Key Questions:**
- How does the "language brain" develop differently in children with disorders?
- What are the neural markers of dyslexia and other language impairments?
- How does brain plasticity support recovery or intervention?

### Artificial Intelligence
<a id="ai"></a>
**Focus:** AI in Language Health

We apply artificial intelligence to the study of language disorders. This involves using machine learning and NLP to assist in screening, analyze complex language behavior data, and build predictive models for diagnosis and prognosis.

**Key Questions:**
- Can AI models accurately screen for language disorders using speech or text data?
- How can we use AI to analyze large-scale behavioral data to find new patterns?
- Can we build predictive models to identify at-risk children earlier?
